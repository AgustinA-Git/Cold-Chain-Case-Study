Cold Chain Spoilage Analysis â€“ Case Study
This project explores a simulated cold chain logistics dataset to identify the key factors that contribute to product spoilage during temperature-sensitive shipments. Using descriptive statistics and visual analytics, we analyze how variables such as transit time, ambient temperature, packaging type, and temperature excursions impact the likelihood and cost of spoilage.

Dataset Features
The dataset includes the following fields:

Order_ID: Unique identifier for each shipment

Product_Type: Frozen, Refrigerated, or Ambient

Order_Weight_lbs: Shipment weight in pounds

Origin_DC / Destination: Distribution center and endpoint

Distance_miles and Transit_Time_hr: Route metrics

Packaging_Type: Type of thermal protection used

Ambient_Temperature_C: Temperature at origin

Carrier, Shipment_Cost_USD, Delivery_Time_Window

Temp_Excursion: Deviation from optimal temperature

Spoilage?: Flag indicating spoilage

Spoilage_Cost_USD: Associated financial loss

Objective
The goal is to determine which operational factors most strongly influence spoilage, enabling smarter decisions in packaging, routing, and scheduling to minimize waste and financial loss.
